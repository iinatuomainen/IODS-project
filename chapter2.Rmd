#Exercise 2

*Describe the work you have done this week and summarize your learning.*

- Data includes 7 following variables: 'gender', 'age', 'attitude', 'deep', 'stra', 'surf' and 'points'. Data includes 166 observations. Age and points are integers, gender is a factor and other variables are numerical.
- Strongest correlation is between attitude and points (positive correaltion), whereas the lowest correlation is between deep and points (negative correlation). All the variables, except gender, are normally distributed.
- I chose attitude, stra and surf as explanatory variables in my model. However, stra and surf did not have a significant realtionship with points variable and therefore I removed them my next model. In the final model, attitude had a significant realationship with the points. And when attitude increases by one unit, the average change in points is 3.5 points
- Multiple R-squared means that aproximately 19 % of the variation in points is explained by the variation in attitude. Therefore 81 % of the variation in points is explained by other explanatory variables.
- Riduals vs Fitted plots implies that the size of erros is not depended on the explanatory variables
- QQ-plot of the residuals shows the assumption that the errors of the model are normally distributed
-Residual vs Leverage measures how much a single observation has on the model. If the Cook's value is value is low, one outlier shouldn't be a problem in reference with assumptions of the model.*
